# MNIST Addition
The digit addition problem is a simple but illustrative example used in [(Manhaeve et al. 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10872) to illustrate DeepProbLogâ€™s ability to do both logical reasoning and deep learning. The task is, given a pair of digit images (MNIST) and their sum as the label, let a neural network learn the digit classification of the input images.

## Train and Test
